#### [Design Process Overview](https://github.com/anisa9/foodwaste-project/wiki/Design-Process-Overview)


#### [Ongoing Documentation](https://github.com/anisa9/foodwaste-project/wiki) 

Contains details of FridgePrintâ€™s design and development including design decisions, research, prototypes and evaluations conducted.   

Links for the prototypes developed can be accessed on in the ongoing documentation link above. Additionally, for reference, embedded here are the links for the [low-fidelity prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/oo8ywaH1suHtHRZZja6lxm/DECO3500--Paper-Prototype-2?node-id=1%3A41&scaling=min-zoom) and [medium-fidelity prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/5EoM6Qwk3NjoFgA3OEOHg3/DECO3500---Medium-Fidelity-Prototype?node-id=1%3A18&scaling=scale-down).

#### Proof-of-Concept Prototype

Proof-of-concept prototype can be accessed and deployed by following this link: https://anisa9.github.io. Make sure to use Chrome so the voice recognition function works.

The code of the prototype can be found in the repository folder here. Optionally, the prototype can be accessed by downloading this folder and running the index.html file in Chrome (for the voice-recognition to function).

For guidance on the interactions FridgePrint provides, the [use and interaction guide](https://github.com/anisa9/foodwaste-project/blob/master/Promotional%20Materials/interaction%20and%20use%20guide.png) can be referenced, or optionally the [task flows](https://github.com/anisa9/foodwaste-project/blob/master/Proof%20of%20Concept%20Prototype/prototype%20task%20flows.png) that outline the key paths and interactions of FridgePrint.
